Impending Judgment is a working third-person shooter game featuring an exhilarating, action-packed, explosive style of gameplay that keeps the player on edge! The primary objective is to stay alive for as long as possible, while taking on hordes of enemies, and simultaneously collecting power rings as they spawn in random locations throughout the level. The tower located at the center of the stage functions as a home base of sorts. When the player approaches it, their health is restored to 100%, allowing them to continue fighting. There's a feature enabling the player to fire lasers, which are intended to freeze enemies in-place temporarily. However, this function is not fully operational at the moment. But in future updates, I expect to have the feature working as expected. This project is a culmination of my current competencies with Unreal Engine and various aspects of Game Development, including graphics programming, A.I. programming, scripting, designing, prototyping, and more!

Are you up for this ballistic challenge!?
