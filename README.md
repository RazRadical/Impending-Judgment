Impending Judgment is a working action title featuring a robust, fast-paced, Run n’ Gun style of play, incorporating gameplay that alternates between Third-Person and 2D Side-Scroller/Rail shooting. It’s characterized by a play style that requires skill, quick reaction time and swift decision making. It will also include a basic melee combat system that borrows elements from the Hack n’ Slash and Beat ‘em Up genres in such a way that compliments its core gameplay mechanics. Down;aodable content (DLC), multiplayer, and various online game modes will be available to players, as well.
